Folder 1D_Wave_Equation_Various_Schemes deals with the solution of 1D Wave Equation with periodic boundary conditions for different numerical schemes viz. FTFS, FTBS, Upwind, Lax-Friedrichs and Lax-Wendroff. Mesh consists of 1D equi-sized cells. Initial values are assigned to cells by averaging over the cell. FVM used.

Folder Multiple_Linear_Wave_Equation deals with the solution of multiple linear wave equations (m x m system of equations) and their solution using the Upwind scheme. The initial conditions are Riemann ICs. Cells are equi-sized. FVM used.
